    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Thick, crisp, and packed with raisins and carroway seeds. This traditional Irish recipe is great for St. Patrick's Day. Best eaten freshly baked and warm or toasted.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cooking spray</li>
      <li>711g / 25 ounces (about 4 ½ cups) all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>36g / 3 tablespoons sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>240g / 1 ½ cups raisins or currants</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon carroway seeds (optional)</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1 ¾ cups buttermilk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 425°F. Grease an 8-inch to 10-inch cast iron skillet.</li>
      <li>In a bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, salt, and baking soda.</li>
      <li>Add butter to dry ingredients and using a pastry cutter or two knives, cut the butter into small piece and incorporate into flour until it is the size of large pebbles.</li>
      <li>Add raisins and carroway seeds (if using) and stir until combined. (Note: The carroway seeds add deep notes of anise to the bread. This strong flavor may be off-putting to people not accustomed to it, so you may want to omit them.)</li>
      <li>In a small bowl, beat eggs.</li>
      <li>Add buttermilk to eggs and stir to combine.</li>
      <li>Pour buttermilk and eggs into bowl with dry ingredients. Using a wooden spoon, stir until ingredients have just combined.</li>
      <li>Using your hands, gently knead the dough until it is rough and scrappy. Do not over mix or over knead the dough as the resulting bread will be tough.</li>
      <li>Gently shape dough into a round and place on a greased cast-iron skillet. Using a knife, score the top of the dough with ½ inch deep cut in an 'X' shape. Pull the dough back slightly to open the 'X'. Transfer to oven and bake until bread is golden and a knife or skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Cool 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
